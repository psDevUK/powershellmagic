Yes this is a problem that seems to have been talked about for years on the internet, but after spending time to look into the issue to see if there was a magic \uD83E\uDDD9 hotfix, or patch to apply to Tenable to resolve the issue and finding one did not exist. Then looking on various forums and seeing other Tenable customers were also suffering from this same issue, but no definitive resolution on how they solved it.","Example of this problem","I did find that someone had set a particular registry entry to read-only which then meant Tenable had to use the next criteria to check if the machine is unique.

I had reached out directly to the vendor expecting some patch or specific setting which could be changed, but again the support I received, did not provide any information to solve this \uD83D\uDE22 and you are still expected to fix the issue, seeming as you were the one who identified it.","I am not to good at planning things in a diagram format, but this was the plan in my head. So my idea was grab all the assets that are in Tenable, dump them to a CSV file, then use a parameter to seach for particular naming conventions, group all those assets, sort them by descending order and skip the first result.\uD83E\uDD2F Then all that are left in the group are duplicate assets that were not the most recently seen, meaning it was a stale duplicate record.

As I know it was going to be used more than once, this to me made it worth while into making this into a function. Maybe even two functions, one to gather all the Tenable assets, then another to find the duplicates.","The above function will gather all the assets registered in Tenable and place them into a CSV. I know I am missing a help section I promise to do better on my next post, but as I was not publishing this anywhere, and I was going to be the one running it, I thought I should remember something like Get-TenableAssets -OutputCSV C:\\Temp\\TenableAssets.csv yes I know I could have used a more standard parameter like path or something similar, but I decided that OutputCSV was good enough for the job. This was my function after all. The more assets you have the longer this function will take to run.","Now I needed another function to actually sort the duplicates from the CSV file.

Then I could use the second function Get-DuplicateTenableAssets to search for various naming conventions that I knew duplicates fell under.

If you work with Tenable you may also know that say fixing 500+ assets with a problem, might only lower the CES score by 1 point.

Not long after I started this job, I realised this is a big company with thousands and thousands of users. To further complicate things this is the first company I have worked at which uses Role Based Access Control aka RBAC. So although the 200+ scripts I look after which do all the on-boarding for users sometimes the data that these accounts are created off could not hold the right information (I have no control over the CSV data) and like the saying goes bad data in bad data out Despite raising this numerous times to fix the underlying issue, the people in-charge of the spreadsheet obviously like to keep me on my toes. Also as not all people in the company might not appreciate the rules configured for RBAC you could have HR change loads of peoples departments, or job titles. This then means that those people are automatically removed from RBAC groups as they no longer meet the given criteria to be in that group. This then leads to being asked why user A can still access what they need but user B can now no longer access the things that they used to be able to access which was the same as user A","Although I am not office based I know that people will look at the MemberOf tab in Active Directory with two user accounts side-by-side and try to do a spot the difference between them. Due to the size of the company I work for also adds a crazy amount of Active Directory groups. So this then becomes a mission to identify the missing group or groups due to the size of the lists shown.","Do not let spotting the difference lead to situations like this"]},{"l":"What was the problem?","p":["Within the first month this problem had presented itself a few times, so wanting to make a good impression and solve this easily going forward I cooked up a very basic function. Honestly I have now used this hundreds of times, and given it to numerous people in numerous IT departments as it has saved my \uD83E\uDD53 so many times when I get asked about why this account cannot do something when another account who should have the same access can.","Put simply, states: “the simplest solution is almost always the best.” It’s a problem-solving principle arguing that simplicity is better than complexity. Named after 14th-century logician and theologian William of Ockham, this theory has been helping many great thinkers for centuries.","Although I was not thinking good old Occam's Razor when I did this, I was thinking that this simple solution would solve this issue in no-time, and it was so simple I kept it as a basic Powershell function, sometimes the simple solution is the best solution. Just crazy how many times I have used this, and even the same people asking me who I have previously given this same function to still ask me, and I run this function, then the issue is revealed which group or groups are missing from one account that the other account has."]},{"l":"Get-ADGroupDifference","p":["You may have noticed that I use the $Global parameter here to store the outcome of the display. I also use the Out-GridView cmdlet to allow easy viewing, sorting and filtering of the data presented."]},{"l":"Bonus solution","p":["The bonus feature is putting this to even more use. If you have managed Active Directory you most likely have been asked that you want userB to have the same permissions or access as userA now I know a lot of people do tend to just copy accounts, but that is not best practices as you do not know exactly what you are copying, and if userB account already exists in Active Directory you do not want to be deleting that account and creating a new copied account as it will get a new GUID and will not match the cloud linked Active Directory account anymore and well it might seem a simple solution, but in this instance it is most certainly not the best solution or idea.","So to achieve being able to say automatically give userB everything that userA has we can simply add a few more lines of code:","This time a double-whammy solution to the age old problem of differences in Active Directory accounts. I know I could have even jazzed up this function for this blog, but it is what it is which has become my saying of late with all the unexpected news I have recently had."]},{"l":"Something to share","p":["Again I need to make some new beats but life has been rather hectic of late, so I hope you enjoy this tune I made not so long ago \uD83C\uDFB5"]}]]
