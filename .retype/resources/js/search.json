[[{"l":"Powershell Magic"},{"l":"Been on my mind","p":["So it has been on my mind \uD83D\uDCAD for quite sometime to build a new website, however I just never got round to it. So tonight whilst walking my dogs \uD83D\uDC15 with the mrs, I got saying how I feel the need to do a super amazing Powershell website \uD83D\uDCAF but just did not feel my mojo \uD83E\uDDE0 was in the right place. My mrs was like:","Just get on and do it, you always over think things"]},{"l":"More thinking","p":["This then led me to think \uD83D\uDCAD well I done a module for retype a while back this should be easy. Sadly seems that module is not working how it used to work since publishing it \uD83D\uDE22. Which got me thinking about how I should have put workflows into all my modules to make them easier to update. Like people say 'hindsight is a great thing' so as my plan A to build this site fell flat on it's face, I decided to go back to the source aka the official site for this great easy to use web designer. The Official Retype Site"]},{"l":"Reading research","p":["As I am that bit older now \uD83D\uDC74 I did further reading of the documentation, and when logging into the hosting site I use to publish personal websites,I discovered I had the same idea six months ago \uD83D\uDCC6 as I had setup this powershell magic domain, \uD83C\uDF0E but obviously the magic stopped there as never got round to publishing it. Having used Azure DevOps for nearly three years now with CI/CD pipelines to commit the work I do on the automation repository and raise a change notification for the change team, I thought this time round I would add in a github workflow to auto publish this site from my associated github repository. This should allow me to knock more pages together in shorter time and hopefully keep you the audience like your favourite TV \uD83D\uDCFA show or comic just hanging to see the next episode, or reading the next title to be published.","Yes I am still reading comics \uD83E\uDDB8 so lets do what I did before and add some lovely pictures and get talking Powershell. This as it says on the picture is The Magic Order and is a totally epic comic written by Mark Millar, currently there is five series of this out, and will hopefully come to Netflix soon."]},{"l":"Previous Powershell blog","p":["My previous blog site (link at the top of the page) led to some amazing things for me, it helped me secure a job, it got me invited to do some Powershell talks to live human beings who attended. I also got to go on the Powershell podcast, I even got a call from Jason Helmick from the official Powershell Microsoft team. I also got to speak to a huge idol of mine Chrissy LeMaire who is like the most awesome person I know (apart from my mrs that is) and life was going great. Sadly I had some personal issues and then basically went and hid in a cave all this time being a hermet \uD83D\uDC1A. I have just been so focused on my job and wanting to give 100% each day that I neglected the blogging that I was really enjoying doing. I stupidly \uD83E\uDD21 also turned down book offers to author a Powershell book from several different publishers (major regret \uD83D\uDE2D) just because I wanted to be 100% focused on my job, and to provide for my family."]},{"l":"New location","p":["Just under a year ago I moved \uD83C\uDFE0 house to a more remote location in the UK, which to be honest feels like I am on holiday everyday as the surroundings are so beautiful, and only a few minutes from the sea. I find the ocean \uD83C\uDF0A so therapeutic to listen and look at the big waves crashing in, I go to the beach everyday to get my fix of mother nature \uD83C\uDFD6️. Then just as I am like I finally done it, life is feeling really good, I get informed that my work wanted to do mass redundancies in IT due to the merger that was done with another company. Despite numerous people telling me I am safe because I am the only person who does x, y and z at work sadly that does not seem to be the case and I felt like this lady at the front of this comic when having the consultation that I was not coming out of this without damage being done:","I so miss my old boss I used to work for in the same company, he was a complete legend and had my back, however the boss I have now is the complete opposite and certainly does not have my back. Else I do not feel I would now be in an uncertain position in life, which I am now faced with, which seems like 90% of LinkedIn members are also in, as in looking for a new position to work in."]},{"l":"Looking for work","p":["However, after notifiying the WWW I am now open for work, this led to a number of Microsoft MVPs to recommend me and re-share my post which really was moving \uD83D\uDC96 as I have not been on social media for time ⏱️ and I am not an MVP myself so to get so much positive feedback from various LinkedIn members and especially Microsoft MVPs also inspired me to get a new website together and show why you should be hiring me."]},{"l":"You made it this far","p":["If you survived reading this landing page congratulations, trust the rest of this site is not about my life dilemmas and will feature lots of \uD83D\uDE0E awesome Powershellness that should leave you feeling \uD83E\uDD2F refreshed. Until the next page comes out, thanks for visiting and hang tight and the code will be coming in the next update."]},{"l":"Something to share","p":["I can however share with you my latest youtube video I made, working on some oldskool house vibes if you like this video the by all means feel free to subscribe as I have been trying to make my own music for a little while now \uD83C\uDFB5"]}],[{"l":"Powershell Magic","p":["As promised in the landing page this time we are actually going to do some powershell magic which to me is being able to provide a script from scratch to deliver the solution to the given problem."]},{"l":"Thinking...","p":["I firmly believe in understanding and thinking of how you will provide a solution to the given problem, and to also have a back-out plan in-place if any changes are being involved. I do not influence violence by any means as the solution, but as the picture above shows, this lady has thought her way out of the problem she was presented with."]},{"l":"Normal rules I follow","p":["Understand the problem\uD83D\uDE15 if you do not understand the problem ask for it t be explained again. Then look to apply a solution which can be re-used to fix the given problem. Normally this involves writing a function and providing certain criteria as parameters, so that you can then change the values of those parameters to meet the given problem you are trying to fix.","Do not re-invent the wheel\uD83C\uDFA1 as in you could potentially go off on a mission to re-create something out there that already exists. So I strongly advise you at least check out the Powershell gallery for any existing modules that may already exist to help you solve the scripting quest you have been presented with. You could also use code specific sites such as GitHub to see if something exists or something to inspire you. Yes at school you may have got yourself into big trouble as this is technically plagiarism but we are not at school anymore.","Do not spend too long looking for something else⏰ to solve the problem for you, as in if you could do the task manually in ten minutes but you spend three hours looking for that solution, then to me that is not time well spent and being efficient. I tend to limit my time reasearching to a maximum of twenty minutes, as I knew this particular task would have taken a lot longer doing this manually, so even if I did not find any modules or scripts of interest I have only invested a maximum of twenty minutes of my time.","Get cooking up a solution\uD83C\uDF73 as in start coding the solution to the problem, I like to add comments so that if someone else should need the code, or you show it to someone who does not fully understand code, they should be able to understand the comments you have made and read through those understanding what your script is going to do and the order it is doing it in."]},{"l":"What was the problem?","p":["Hopefully as the link suggested the issue was numerous zero-day threats discovered from an article my boss had read Security Article My boss wanted me to verify that each of those zero-day threats we had protection against in SCCM. Although SCCM is amazing in deploying various items across you network, I do find it extremely point and clicky and sometimes over-kill to get the information you are after. So I knew about the Configuration Manager module, as I have used it to build my own stream-lined SCCM dashbaord. However how could I get all the CVE information from the website I was provided a link to and then double check that the fix had been setup in SCCM?","This is where you use twenty minutes of your time wisely, which led me to a module I had never heard of or used before MSRCSECURITYUPDATES","Using this module, I could reference any given CVE threat, then obtain the KB article number which has been released to fix that specific CVE threat. This would same me a lot of time from trying to obtain this off of the internet, and again save me a lot of point and clicking. \uD83D\uDC01"]},{"l":"What was your solution?","p":["Although I did mention functions in my previous normal rules I follow, as this was the first time of being asked to provide this type of information in the two years and eleven months I have worked at this company, this did more seem like a one-off request. I normally write the script, then if I see that the script could be useful say to check this on numerous computers, and other filters, then yes I would most certainly make this into a function so that you do not have to manually edit the script each time. As this was a one-off request then I decided producing a script to provide the answer of yes the patch is in SCCM and has been deployed or no these CVEs are not currently protected against in SCCM was a good enough solid answer to the problem I was provided with."]},{"l":"The end solution"},{"l":"Thank you","p":["Again thanks for your time reading this article and hopefully this has given you some ideas \uD83D\uDCA1 in your head on fixing a similar issue you may have been presented with at work, or just little tips used to be more effective in providing a scripted solution to any given problem. In total this took less than an hour to produce from the initial question being asked, and I was certain that the information returned was correct. Thankfully all patches did exist in SCCM and that was that."]},{"l":"Something to share","p":["Recent times have been pretty emotional for me, especially with more recent news. I do find music can help, and even better if you can put a tune together to show how you are feeling. so I hope you enjoy this emotion tune I made \uD83C\uDFB5","Until next time, stay safe and see you again soon for another Powershell solution \uD83D\uDE01"]}]]
