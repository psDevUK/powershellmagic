[[{"l":"Powershell Magic","p":["So it has been on my mind \uD83D\uDCAD for quite sometime to build a new website, however I just never got round to it. So tonight whilst walking my dogs \uD83D\uDC15 with the mrs, I got saying how I feel the need to do a super amazing Powershell website \uD83D\uDCAF but just did not feel my mojo \uD83E\uDDE0 was in the right place. My mrs was like:","Just get on and do it, you always over think things","This then led me to think \uD83D\uDCAD well I done a module for retype a while back this should be easy. Sadly seems that module is not working how it used to work since publishing it \uD83D\uDE22. Which got me thinking about how I should have put workflows into all my modules to make them easier to update. Like people say 'hindsight is a great thing' so as my plan A to build this site fell flat on it's face, I decided to go back to the source aka the official site for this great easy to use web designer. The Official Retype Site","As I am that bit older now \uD83D\uDC74 I did further reading of the documentation, and when logging into the hosting site I use to publish personal websites,I discovered I had the same idea six months ago \uD83D\uDCC6 as I had setup this powershell magic domain, \uD83C\uDF0E but obviously the magic stopped there as never got round to publishing it. Having used Azure DevOps for nearly three years now with CI/CD pipelines to commit the work I do on the automation repository and raise a change notification for the change team, I thought this time round I would add in a github workflow to auto publish this site from my associated github repository. This should allow me to knock more pages together in shorter time and hopefully keep you the audience like your favourite TV \uD83D\uDCFA show or comic just hanging to see the next episode, or reading the next title to be published.","Yes I am still reading comics \uD83E\uDDB8 so lets do what I did before and add some lovely pictures and get talking Powershell. This as it says on the picture is The Magic Order and is a totally epic comic written by Mark Millar, currently there is five series of this out, and will hopefully come to Netflix soon.","My previous blog site (link at the top of the page) led to some amazing things for me, it helped me secure a job, it got me invited to do some Powershell talks to live human beings who attended. I also got to go on the Powershell podcast, I even got a call from Jason Helmick from the official Powershell Microsoft team. I also got to speak to a huge idol of mine Chrissy LeMaire who is like the most awesome person I know (apart from my mrs that is) and life was going great. Sadly I had some personal issues and then basically went and hid in a cave all this time being a hermet \uD83D\uDC1A. I have just been so focused on my job and wanting to give 100% each day that I neglected the blogging that I was really enjoying doing. I stupidly \uD83E\uDD21 also turned down book offers to author a Powershell book from several different publishers (major regret \uD83D\uDE2D) just because I wanted to be 100% focused on my job, and to provide for my family.","Just under a year ago I moved \uD83C\uDFE0 house to a more remote location in the UK, which to be honest feels like I am on holiday everyday as the surroundings are so beautiful, and only a few minutes from the sea. I find the ocean \uD83C\uDF0A so therapeutic to listen and look at the big waves crashing in, I go to the beach everyday to get my fix of mother nature \uD83C\uDFD6️. Then just as I am like I finally done it, life is feeling really good, I get informed that my work wanted to do mass redundancies in IT due to the merger that was done with another company. Despite numerous people telling me I am safe because I am the only person who does x, y and z at work sadly that does not seem to be the case and I felt like this lady at the front of this comic when having the consultation that I was not coming out of this without damage being done:","I so miss my old boss I used to work for in the same company, he was a complete legend and had my back, however the boss I have now is the complete opposite and certainly does not have my back. Else I do not feel I would now be in an uncertain position in life, which I am now faced with, which seems like 90% of LinkedIn members are also in, as in looking for a new position to work in.","However, after notifiying the WWW I am now open for work, this led to a number of Microsoft MVPs to recommend me and re-share my post which really was moving \uD83D\uDC96 as I have not been on social media for time ⏱️ and I am not an MVP myself so to get so much positive feedback from various LinkedIn members and especially Microsoft MVPs also inspired me to get a new website together and show why you should be hiring me.","If you survived reading this landing page congratulations, trust the rest of this site is not about my life dilemmas and will feature lots of \uD83D\uDE0E awesome Powershellness that should leave you feeling \uD83E\uDD2F refreshed. Until the next page comes out, thanks for visiting and hang tight and the code will be coming in the next update.","I can however share with you my latest youtube video I made, working on some oldskool house vibes if you like this video the by all means feel free to subscribe as I have been trying to make my own music for a little while now \uD83C\uDFB5"]}]]
