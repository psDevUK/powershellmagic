# Powershell Magic [!badge variant="warning" text="Back once again with the Powershell :bacon: flavour"]

## Been on my mind
So it has been on my mind :thought_balloon: for quite sometime to build a new website, however I just never got round to it. So tonight whilst walking my dogs :dog2: with the mrs, I got saying how I feel the need to do a super amazing Powershell website :100: but just did not feel my mojo :brain: was in the right place. My mrs was like:

!!! :female-judge: Stop Procrastinating
Just get on and do it, you always over think things
!!!

## More thinking
This then led me to think :thought_balloon: well I done a module for retype a while back this should be easy.  Sadly seems that module is not working how it used to work since publishing it :cry:. Which got me thinking about how I should have put workflows into all my modules to make  them easier to update.  Like people say 'hindsight is a great thing' so as my plan A to build this site fell flat on it's face, I decided to go back to the source aka the official site for this great easy to use web designer.

## Reading research
As I am that bit older now :older_man: I did further reading of the documentation, and when logging into the hosting site I use to publish personal websites,I discovered I had the same idea six months ago :calendar: as I had setup this **powershell magic** domain, :earth_americas: but obviously the magic stopped there as never got round to publishing it. 
Having used Azure DevOps for nearly three years now with CI/CD pipelines to commit the work I do on the automation repository and raise a change notification for the change team, I thought this time round I would add in a github workflow to auto publish this site from my associated github repository. This should allow me to knock more pages together in shorter time and hopefully keep you the audience like your favourite TV :tv: show or comic just hanging to see the next episode, or reading the next title to be published. 

Yes I am still reading comics :superhero: so lets do what I did before and add some lovely pictures and get talking Powershell. This as it says on the picture is **The Magic Order** and is a totally epic comic written by Mark Millar, currently there is five series of this out, and will hopefully come to Netflix soon.

## Previous Powershell blog
My previous blog site (link at the top of the page) led to some amazing things for me, it helped me secure a job, it got me invited to do some Powershell talks to live human beings who attended. I also got to go on the Powershell podcast, I even got a call from Jason Helmick from the official Powershell Microsoft team.  I also got to speak to a huge idol of mine Chrissy LeMaire who is like the most awesome person I know (apart from my mrs that is) and life was going great. 
Sadly I had some personal issues and then basically went and hid in a cave all this time being a hermet :shell:. I have just been so focused on my job and wanting to give 100% each day that I neglected the blogging that I was really enjoying doing. I stupidly :clown_face: also turned down book offers to author a Powershell book from several different publishers (major regret :sob:) just because I wanted to be 100% focused on my job, and to provide for my family. 

## New location
Just under a year ago I moved :house: house to a more remote location in the UK, which to be honest feels like I am on holiday everyday as the surroundings are so beautiful, and only a few minutes from the sea. I find the ocean :ocean: so therapeutic to listen and look at the big waves crashing in, I go to the beach everyday to get my fix of mother nature :beach_with_umbrella:. 
Then just as I am like I finally done it, life is feeling really good, I get informed that my work wanted to do mass redundancies in IT due to the merger that was done with another company. 
Despite numerous people telling me I am safe because I am the only person who does x, y and z at work sadly that does not seem to be the case and I felt like this lady at the front of this comic when having the consultation that I was not coming out of this without damage being done:

I so miss my old boss I used to work for in the same company, he was a complete legend and had my back, however the boss I have now is the complete opposite and certainly does not have my back. Else I do not feel I would now be in an uncertain position in life, which I am now faced with, which seems like 90% of LinkedIn members are also in, as in looking for a new position to work in. 

## Looking for work
However, after notifiying the WWW I am now open for work, this led to a number of Microsoft MVPs to recommend me and re-share my post which really was moving :sparkling_heart: as I have not been on social media for time :stopwatch: and I am not an MVP myself so to get so much positive feedback from various LinkedIn members and especially Microsoft MVPs also inspired me to get a new website together and show why you should be hiring me.

## You made it this far
If you survived reading this landing page congratulations, trust the rest of this site is not about my life dilemmas and will feature lots of :sunglasses: awesome Powershellness that should leave you feeling :exploding_head: refreshed. Until the next page comes out, thanks for visiting and hang tight and the code will be coming in the next update.

## Something to share
I can however share with you my latest youtube video I made, working on some oldskool house vibes if you like this video the by all means feel free to subscribe as I have been trying to make my own music for a little while now :musical_note:
